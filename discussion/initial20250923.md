- **Random graph thresholds**: Determining precise threshold functions for various properties in random graph models

**Dynamics and Processes**
- **Synchronization in complex networks**: Understanding when and how oscillators synchronize on different network topologies, especially with heterogeneous coupling
- **Epidemic spreading models**: Developing more realistic models that capture behavioral changes, multiple pathogen strains, and network adaptation during outbreaks
- **Opinion dynamics convergence**: Predicting consensus formation and polarization in social networks with various update rules

**Network Formation and Evolution**
- **Preferential attachment variants**: Understanding which mechanisms best explain real-world degree distributions and clustering patterns
- **Multiplex network evolution**: How interdependent networks co-evolve and influence each other's structure
- **Temporal network patterns**: Characterizing and predicting time-varying network structures

**Controllability and Optimization**
- **Network controllability**: Determining the minimum number of driver nodes needed to control complex networks and understanding structural controllability
- **Influence maximization**: Finding optimal strategies for information diffusion with realistic constraints and competing influences
- **Network robustness optimization**: Designing networks that are simultaneously efficient and resilient to various types of failures

**Applications to Real Systems**
- **Brain network function**: Connecting structural brain networks to cognitive functions and disorders
- **Ecological network stability**: Understanding how food web topology affects ecosystem resilience
- **Social network inference**: Reconstructing hidden social structures from behavioral data

These problems often require interdisciplinary approaches combining graph theory, statistical physics, machine learning, and domain-specific knowledge.

## Spectral properties
Evelyn: What are the spectral properties of a network?

Claude: 
There are several excellent open-source tools for computing spectral properties of networks across different programming languages:

**Python Libraries**

**NetworkX**
- Most popular general-purpose network analysis library
- Functions: `nx.adjacency_spectrum()`, `nx.laplacian_spectrum()`, `nx.normalized_laplacian_spectrum()`
- Easy integration with NumPy/SciPy for eigenvalue computations
- Good for moderate-sized networks and prototyping

**igraph-python**
- Python interface to the igraph library
- Fast C implementation underneath
- Functions: `graph.spectrum()`, `graph.laplacian()`, `graph.get_adjacency()`
- Better performance than NetworkX for large networks

**graph-tool**
- High-performance library with C++ core
- Advanced spectral methods and statistical inference
- Functions for Laplacian eigenvalues, spectral clustering
- Handles very large networks efficiently

**SciPy/NumPy**
- Direct eigenvalue computation with `scipy.linalg.eigh()` or `numpy.linalg.eigh()`
- ARPACK interface for sparse eigenvalue problems via `scipy.sparse.linalg.eigsh()`
- Most flexible for custom matrix constructions

**R Packages**

**igraph**
- R version of igraph library
- Functions: `spectrum()`, `graph.laplacian()`, `eigen_centrality()`
- Excellent for statistical analysis of spectral properties

**RSpectra**
- R interface to Spectra C++ library
- Efficient computation of partial eigenvalue decompositions
- Good for large sparse matrices

**sna (Social Network Analysis)**
- Specialized for social network analysis
- Various centrality measures based on eigenvalues

**Julia**

**Graphs.jl**
- Core graph library with spectral functions
- `adjacency_matrix()`, `laplacian_matrix()`, `normalized_laplacian()`
- Fast performance with native Julia linear algebra

**LightGraphs.jl** (now Graphs.jl)
- Merged into Graphs.jl
- Efficient implementations of spectral algorithms

**C/C++ Libraries**

**igraph**
- Core C library underlying Python/R interfaces
- Direct C API for maximum performance
- Functions: `igraph_adjacency()`, `igraph_laplacian()`

**SNAP (Stanford Network Analysis Platform)**
- C++ library for large-scale network analysis
- Good for massive networks but fewer spectral-specific functions

**Specialized Tools**

**MATLAB**
- Built-in eigenvalue functions: `eig()`, `eigs()`, `svd()`
- Graph theory toolbox available
- Many research implementations available

**Gephi**
- GUI-based network visualization tool
- Plugins available for spectral analysis
- Good for interactive exploration

**Cytoscape**
- Network visualization and analysis platform
- Various plugins for spectral properties
- Popular in biological network analysis

**Performance Considerations**

For **small to medium networks** (< 10,000 nodes):
- NetworkX is convenient and sufficient
- Direct NumPy/SciPy eigenvalue computation works well

For **large networks** (> 100,000 nodes):
- Use graph-tool, igraph, or Julia implementations
- Consider sparse eigenvalue solvers (ARPACK via SciPy)
- May need to compute only partial spectra

For **very large networks**:
- Specialized algorithms for approximate eigenvalues
- Consider spectral sparsification techniques
- Tools like SNAP or custom C++ implementations

**Recommendation**
Start with **NetworkX** for learning and small problems, then move to **igraph** (Python/R) or **graph-tool** for larger networks. Use **SciPy's sparse eigenvalue solvers** when you need fine control over the computation or are working with custom matrix constructions.

## Research setup

Evelyn: 
Can you help me plan a colab notebook research setup for this?  I'd like to be able to download data, or generate it. Then id like to be able to save a sqllite database of the network description, and the values of each of the calculated properties, as well as an image of the network. Some of what I woul like to research is performance of different algorithms for calculating properties, so id like an id for the property code, and a run datetime and timing of the run. There will be multiple runs over the same data, some with the same algorithm and some with different ones. Any suggestions you may have about storing that sort of time series data would be appreciated. Please ask any questions you may have.

Claude: 
This sounds like a great research project! I have some questions to help design the optimal setup for your needs:

**Data and Network Scope:**
1. What size networks are you planning to work with? (hundreds, thousands, or millions of nodes?)
2. Are you focusing on specific types of networks (social, biological, transportation) or want flexibility for multiple domains?
3. Do you need to handle directed vs undirected, weighted vs unweighted, or temporal networks?

**Properties and Algorithms:**
4. Which spectral properties are you most interested in? (full spectrum, just eigenvalue gaps, specific eigenvectors, etc.)
5. Are you comparing different algorithms for the same property (e.g., different eigenvalue solvers) or different properties entirely?
6. Do you want to track algorithm parameters/settings as well as just the algorithm type?

**Performance Analysis:**
7. Are you interested in just runtime, or also memory usage, convergence behavior, numerical accuracy?
8. Do you want to track system information (CPU, memory available, etc.) that might affect performance?

**Database Design:**
9. How important is query performance vs storage efficiency? (affects normalization level)
10. Do you anticipate sharing this data or collaborating with others?

**Visualization:**
11. What type of network images? (simple layouts, specific algorithms like force-directed, spectral layouts?)
12. Do you want to store multiple visualization types per network?

Based on your description, I'm thinking of a schema like:

```
Networks (id, name, source, node_count, edge_count, created_at, ...)
Algorithms (id, name, category, version, parameters_json, ...)
Experiments (id, network_id, algorithm_id, run_datetime, runtime_ms, result_json, system_info, ...)
Visualizations (id, network_id, image_blob, layout_type, created_at, ...)
```

Would this structure work for your needs? Any additional metadata you'd want to track?

Evelyn: clarify
