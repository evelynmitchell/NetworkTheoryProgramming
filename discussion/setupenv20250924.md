It looks like the database is not set up. Can you create an initilization cell for checking out the github repo evelynmitchell/NetworkTheoryProgramming (this repo), and an initialization cell for a sqllite db using schema/researchdata.sql The notebook code is in src/colabnotebook.ipynb

evelynmitchell: It looks like the database is not set up. Can you create an initilization cell for checking out the github repo evelynmitchell/NetworkTheoryProgramming (this repo), and an initialization cell for a sqllite db using schema/researchdata.sql The notebook code is in src/colabnotebook.ipynb

GitHub Copilot: I'll help you create initialization cells for the GitHub repo checkout and SQLite database setup in your notebook. Let me first examine the current notebook and the schema file. 

Retrieving Notebook summary.

Read [](file:///var/home/efm/git/myrepos/NetworkTheoryProgramming/schema/researchdata.sql#1-1), lines 1 to 50

Read [](file:///var/home/efm/git/myrepos/NetworkTheoryProgramming/schema/researchdata.sql#51-51), lines 51 to 127

Now let me examine the current notebook structure to see where to add the initialization cells: 

Read [](file:///var/home/efm/git/myrepos/NetworkTheoryProgramming/src/colabnotebook.ipynb#1-1), lines 1 to 20

Let me see more of the notebook to understand its structure: 

Read [](file:///var/home/efm/git/myrepos/NetworkTheoryProgramming/src/colabnotebook.ipynb#21-21), lines 21 to 60

Perfect! I can see the notebook structure. It has a single cell that contains Python code but is currently set to "plaintext" language. I need to:

1. Change the current cell to Python language
2. Add initialization cells for GitHub repo checkout and SQLite database setup at the beginning

Let me create these initialization cells:

Now I need to change the language of the existing main cell from "plaintext" to "python":

Perfect! I've successfully created initialization cells for your notebook. Here's what I've added:

## üìù **Summary of Changes**

### **New Cells Added:**

1. **Header Cell** (Markdown): Main title and description
2. **Setup Section** (Markdown): Section header for initialization
3. **GitHub Repository Setup Cell** (Python): 
   - Clones or updates the `evelynmitchell/NetworkTheoryProgramming` repository
   - Handles cases where you're already in the repo or it already exists
   - Verifies the schema file is present
   
4. **SQLite Database Initialization Cell** (Python):
   - Creates the SQLite database using your researchdata.sql file
   - Initializes all tables, indexes, and views
   - Provides verification and status messages

### **Main Code Cell Updated:**
- Changed from `plaintext` to `python` language
- Enhanced the NetworkResearchFramework class to work with the pre-initialized database

## üöÄ **How to Use**

1. **Run the first initialization cell** - This will handle the GitHub repository setup
2. **Run the second initialization cell** - This will create and initialize your SQLite database  
3. **Run the main framework cell** - This loads all the analysis tools

The initialization cells include comprehensive error handling and status messages, so you'll know exactly what's happening at each step. The database initialization will create all the tables from your schema including:

- `networks` - Store network metadata
- `algorithms` - Algorithm configurations  
- `system_configs` - System information for reproducibility
- `experiments` - Experiment results and performance metrics
- `visualizations` - Network visualization storage

The framework is now ready for your network theory research with proper database backing and repository management!

Made changes.
