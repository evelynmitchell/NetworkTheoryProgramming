Collecting workspace information# Network Theory Programming Project Summary

## High-Level Understanding

This is a research framework project focused on **spectral properties analysis of networks** with an emphasis on **algorithm performance comparison**. The project aims to systematically evaluate different computational methods for calculating spectral properties (eigenvalues, eigenvectors, spectral gaps, etc.) across various network types and sizes.

## Project Goals

### Primary Objective
- **Algorithm Performance Benchmarking**: Compare the performance of different algorithms (NetworkX, SciPy, igraph, etc.) for computing spectral properties of networks
- **Spectral Properties Research**: Analyze relationships between network structure and spectral characteristics

### Research Questions
- Which algorithms perform best for different network sizes and types?
- How do spectral properties vary across network topologies (scale-free, small-world, random, etc.)?
- What are the trade-offs between accuracy, speed, and memory usage for different spectral computation methods?
